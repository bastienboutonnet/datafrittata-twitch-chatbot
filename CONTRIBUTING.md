# Sure feel free to help

## Code Style and Things

-   Python >= 3.9
-   I use black
-   I use spaces
-   You mostly don't have to worry about it because pre-commit.ci will take care of it.

## Install the reqs

-   Make sure you install the `requirements.txt` **and** the `dev-requirements.txt` if you want to contribute.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt dev-requirements.txt
```

-   I'd advise you to install `pre-commit` if you want to make sure the code in your PR doesn't get auto-fixed by the pre-commit ci step. **less surprises, but entirely up to you!**

## It's a small thing?

-   Go ahead an open a PR

## It's a bit bigger? A new feature?

-   Maybe best to [open an issue](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/datafrittata-twitch-chatbot/issues/new) or discuss it on my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/datafrittata). **Mostly, I don't want to make you waste time**.
