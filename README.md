# datafrittata-twitch-chatbot

Another twitch chatbot that **currently** building on stream. It's hacky as hell and I'm sure it's also going to be over-engineered.
It's built in Python cos that's the only language I can pretend I know a few things about. Mostly, chat tells me what to do, I pretend to disagee and then I do what they say anyway ðŸ¤¦.

Come hang out on stream, I'm called [DataFrittata](https://www.twitch.tv/datafrittata)

## I have some plans:

You can of course check the [issues](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/datafrittata-twitch-chatbot/issues) if you're curious but high-level:

-   I do want to make it **async** because I need an excuse to learn `asyncio` in Python.
-   I want to hook it up to a database and track _all the things_ and go from there.

## Feel free to use it, if you dare :)

Instructions to come soon! Cos it breaks a lot and you probably don't want to suffer.

## Want to contribute, make it better?

Yes! I'm totally open for PRs. I have opinions, most of the time, let's discus it [on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/datafrittata) or feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/datafrittata-twitch-chatbot/issues/new) especially if it's for a large change so that you don't end up wasting your time.
